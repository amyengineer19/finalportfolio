		<p>I am currently a student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan School of Information</a>,
			pursing a Master's degree in User Experience and Human Computer Interaction.
            I have a work background in volunteer management and community advocacy and a bachelor's in Anthropology.
            After seeing how the right platform can change how I do my work and how I managed my volunteer program, I
            decided to pursue a graduate degree in UX because I want create technologies that work in all settings. It has been
            rewarding to use my anthropological skills and community experience to think beyond the tech bubble.
            Technology that provides utility and enhances people's lives is tech that makes sense.  Anything less than
            that just won't do. Information and technology have a lot of power to create, design, and lead our futures.
            I want to create the future, but a carefully crafted one, built on transparency, accessibility, and positive
            impact.
        </p>

		<p>Diversity in tech is really important to me, because I am a woman of color.  I plan on using my
			life experiences and my experiences creating inclusive environments to make sure the field is as equitable
			and inclusive for all.  Afterall, if we are desigining for people, then all people need to be at the table.

		<p>My hobbies include baking (I make a mean blueberry muffin!), traveling, taking care of my house plants, and
			hanging out with my roommate's cat, Bessie.  I am passionate about civic engagement and try to volunteer
			in my community often.  I also think it's important to get fresh air (yes, even in the winter!), so you
			can catch me going on runs in my neighborhood in Ann Arbor.  I am currently seeking a full time UX
			Researcher or Product Manager position upon graduation.</p>
