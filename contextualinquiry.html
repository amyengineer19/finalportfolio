                    <a href="https://amyeng.myportfolio.com/case-study-client-recruitment">The Problem</a>- the client expressed
                    frustration with their current database management system and their  process for customer
                    recruitment and matching, a project that takes the whole year.  After meeting with the client
                    to understand their goals for this project, we were ready to start conducting interviews
                    with different stakeholder groups.

                <p>
                    Contextual Inquiry- prepping the interview questions well in advance proved useful and I improved my
                    inquiry skills with each interview.  I used the 5 Whys method to understand what people don't like about
                    the process and their interactions with their customers.  I was able to collect a lot of qualitative data.

            <div class="rowgap" id="thirdparagraph">
                <p>First, the team and I had to gather up the data and create our affinity notes.  We went with the
                    general rule of 1 affinity note per minute of interview.  Our medium of choice was Miro, which
                    is an online whiteboarding system.  We sorted through the data by creating groupings of
                    similiar findings.  This is called affinity mapping</p>

                <p>
                    Affinity Wall- these grouping were very helpful for seeing the common problems that the
                    interviewees were facing.  Next, we reviewed these insights and had a lengthy discussion on how to
                    translate these insights into recommendations for how their new platform, Salesforce, should function.

                    Productive Client Solutions- the process was very informative and led to several implications.
                    Every finding was attached to a recommendation.  I personally strived to ensure that every recommendation
                    included actionable steps, with a timeline and the intended improved outcomes.  We tried to be as
                    thorough as possible.

                    For example, it became apparent that their process of recruiting, scoping, and matching customers
                    to the right program is a lengthy process that has several points of possible improvement.

                    It was very important that the organization start training their employees to work with all of the
                    clients well in advance.  This will help with the influx of customers that come in.

                    Communicating with their clients often enough to keep them in the loop is an essential part of ensuring
                    that their clients have a good matching experience.  This is because the process is very lengthy, so there are
                    several points were clients could drop off.  It was important to explain why that is something they should be extra
                    careful of.

                    The organization has decided to switch their client database to the Salesforce platform.  They should work
                    directly with the Salesforce service representatives to ensure that they are making the most of the platform.
                    They should also make sure that the things they like and don't like about Airtable is properly translated
                    to the new platform.
